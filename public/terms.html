        <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MPHaven PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:</p>

        <h2>15. Indemnification</h2>

        <h2>16. Dispute Resolution, Arbitration, and Class Action Waiver</h2>
        
        <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>Informal Dispute Resolution:</strong> Before filing any formal claim, you agree to first contact us at legal@mphaven.com to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. Please include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name and email address</li>
            <li>A detailed description of the dispute</li>
            <li>The relief you are seeking</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will attempt to resolve the dispute within 30 days. If we cannot resolve it informally, either party may proceed with formal dispute resolution.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Binding Arbitration:</strong> Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the app (including the formation, performance, or breach thereof) shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect, except as modified by these Terms.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Arbitration Procedures:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The arbitration shall be held in the county of your residence at the time the claim is filed, or if no such county can be determined, in Kent County, Delaware</li>
            <li>The arbitration may be conducted in person, by video conference, or by telephone if mutually agreed</li>
            <li>The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding</li>
            <li>Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction</li>
            <li>Each party will bear their own costs and fees, unless otherwise awarded by the arbitrator</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> YOU AND MPHaven AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE RELIEF ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. This prevents you from participating in or being represented in any class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration against MPHaven.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Jury Trial Waiver:</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND MPHaven IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE APP.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Small Claims Court Exception:</strong> Notwithstanding the above, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court if the claim is within the court's jurisdiction and proceeds only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Opt-Out Right:</strong> You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to legal@mphaven.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. Your opt-out notice must include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your full name</li>
            <li>Email address associated with your account</li>
            <li>Clear statement that you wish to opt out of the arbitration agreement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you opt out, all other terms still apply, but you and MPHaven will not be bound by the arbitration provisions above.</p>
        
        <h2>17. Governing Law and Venue</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state in which you reside at the time of accepting these Terms, or if your state of residence cannot be determined, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
        
        <p>If you opted out of arbitration, any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms or the app shall be instituted exclusively in the state or federal courts located in your county of residence, or if your county cannot be determined, in the courts of Kent County, Delaware. You consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>
        
        <h2>18. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable, invalid, or illegal by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
        
        <h2>19. Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and Legal Disclaimer (all available at MPHaven), constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and MPHaven regarding the app and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding such subject matter.</p>
        
        <h2>20. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. If we make material changes that reduce your rights or increase your obligations, we will notify you by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Email to the address associated with your account</li>
            <li>In-app notification</li>
            <li>Posting notice on the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Changes will become effective 30 days after notification (the "Notice Period"). Your continued use of the app after the Notice Period constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using the app and may cancel your account.</p>
        
        <h2>21. Assignment</h2>
        <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent. MPHaven may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of this section shall be void.</p>
        
        <h2>22. Survival</h2>
        <p>All provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnification obligations, limitations of liability, dispute resolution provisions, and this survival clause.</p>
